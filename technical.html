            Discovered how phishing emails were being sent from various email
            domains to the company. Resolved the issue by segregating email IDs
            into authentic and spam domains using Python and CSV files.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            Identified the root cause of phishing emails affecting the company and implemented a solution to enhance system performance. Segregated approximately 3 million email IDs stored in an Excel sheet into authentic and spam categories using Python and CSV integration. This effort reduced the likelihood of system slowdowns caused by phishing emails by 40%.
